# Cravory

This is a modern, responsive restaurant website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with a Node.js and Express backend to handle contact form submissions. User messages are stored in a PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin. An admin route is available to view all submitted messages.
